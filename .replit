# .replit
# For a Python project, we usually use 'python' as the run command.
# For Streamlit, we run 'streamlit run dashboard/app.py'.
# We need both. We can run the main trading logic in the background
# and then launch Streamlit.

# This tells Replit how to run your project.
# It uses a specific Python interpreter.
run = "echo Hello from Replit"

# Define entrypoint for the primary application logic
entrypoint = "main.py"

# Language and environment setup
language = "python"
# The 'modules' key is important for setting up the Python environment.
# 'python-3.10:v2-20230101' specifies a Python 3.10 environment.
modules = ["python-3.10:v2-20230101"]

# Configure environment variables (optional, but good practice for secrets)
# env = {
#     "FYERS_APP_ID": "your_fyers_app_id",
#     "FYERS_SECRET_KEY": "your_fyers_secret_key",
#     "FYERS_REDIRECT_URI": "your_fyers_redirect_uri",
#     "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN": "your_telegram_bot_token",
#     "TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID": "your_telegram_chat_id"
# }

# For web projects, specify port and host
[deployment]
# You might need to adjust the port if Streamlit changes its default or if you have conflicts
port = 8501
# host = "0.0.0.0" # Usually not needed for Replit, it handles routing
